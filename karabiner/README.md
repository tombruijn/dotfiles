# Karabiner Elements config

Since macOS Sierra [Seil](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en) no
longer works, so I use
[Karabiner Elements](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements) instead.

The `configuration` will be symlinked to `~/.karabiner/configuration`.
It will become active immediately.

## Configuration

- Capslock is replaced with Esc.

### Quirks

Karabiner elements resets the layout to a US based layout or something and
swaps the `\`` and `ยง` on a Dutch keyboard. This configuration changes that
back by swapping the `grave_accent_and_tilde` and `non_us_backslash` keys.
